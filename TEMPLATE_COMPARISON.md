## Recommended standard for Troselab

**Use `greenelab/lab-website-template`** for the first migration stage.

Why:
- purpose-built for lab websites rather than individual portfolios,
- straightforward content model (pages + members + data cards),
- easy to hand over and maintain with simple markdown edits,
- practical path to self-hosted static deployment.

## When to switch later

If you want heavier visual customization and design system controls with a larger theme ecosystem, consider a second migration to HugoBlox once content and governance workflows are stabilized.

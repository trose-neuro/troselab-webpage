Group leader of the Rose Group "Circuit Mechanisms of Behavior".

Research focus: circuit mechanisms that stabilize neural representations across perception, learning, and memory while preserving adaptability.
Current work spans representational drift in visual pathways, memory-related coding in retrosplenial cortex, and active vision during orienting behavior.

The lab combines longitudinal optophysiology, closed-loop behavior, and computational modeling, and contributes to collaborative infrastructure initiatives including iBehave and shared data/technology platforms.

University of Bonn Medical Center

### Short Description
We study how dynamic cortical and subcortical circuits produce stable perception, memory, and action in changing environments.

### Long Description
Our research addresses the stability-plasticity conundrum in the mouse visual system, dorsal cortex, thalamus, and hippocampal formation. We combine densely quantified closed-loop behavior, longitudinal optophysiology from synapses to circuits, and computational modeling across timescales from milliseconds to months. Current work focuses on representational drift and feedback stabilization, spatial and contextual memory representations in retrosplenial cortex, active sensing during visual orienting, and uncertainty-dependent neuromodulation. Across these themes, we build technology and analysis frameworks that link circuit dynamics to adaptive behavior in naturalistic conditions.

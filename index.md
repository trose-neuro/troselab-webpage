Stability is a central challenge for the brain. Neural circuits must adapt while preserving reliable perception, memory, and action.
We study the circuit mechanisms that stabilize computation during passive experience and active behavior.

## Current Work

- Representational drift and stabilization in cortical and subcortical circuits in passive vision and active behavior
- Spatial and contextual coding in retrosplenial cortex
- Active visual orienting and peri-saccadic processing in natural vision
- Latent visual learning in cortical networks

Seven active projects test how stable coding emerges in dynamic circuits.
Work combines two-photon imaging, targeted perturbation, and deep receptive-field modeling.

All listed projects are current.
They cover representational drift, memory stabilization, active vision, uncertainty-dependent drift, affordance coding, and latent learning.

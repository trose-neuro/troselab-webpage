Our brain faces a fundamental challenge: it must rewire to learn from experience while still representing the external world consistently enough for reliable action.
In the Rose Group at the IEECR, we study the stability and stabilization of neural codes in visual perception, learning, and memory during passive experience and active behavior.

We address the stability-plasticity conundrum in the interconnected mouse visual system, retrosplenial cortex, and hippocampal formation from synapses to circuits.
Our approach combines densely quantified behavioral paradigms, longitudinal optophysiology, and miniaturized and bench-top two-photon microscopy.

## Current Work

- Stable and flexible coding across cortical and subcortical circuits
- Active vision during visual orienting behavior
- Latent learning and crossmodal integration in cortical circuits 
- Contextual processing during spatial learning
- State, neuromodulation, and uncertainty-dependent dynamics in cortical circuits

{% include section.html %}

Stability is a central challenge for the brain: neural circuits must remain adaptable enough to learn from experience while preserving reliable perception, memory, and behavior.
In the Rose Group, we study the circuit mechanisms that stabilize computation and memory across dynamic sensory environments and behavioral states.

## Current Program

- Long-term representational stability in visual thalamocortical circuits
- Stabilization of spatial and contextual representations in retrosplenial cortex during learning and memory
- Active visual orienting and peri-saccadic processing in natural vision

Seven current projects targeting representational drift, natural vision, learning, and latent learning.
The program combines longitudinal optophysiology, closed-loop behavior, deep modeling, and circuit-level perturbation.

Current projects are organized across representational stability, memory, natural vision, and latent learning, with explicit timelines, milestones, and technology development tracks.
This includes work on feedback stabilization, RSC memory circuits, active orienting, uncertainty-dependent drift, affordance coding, and latent learning.

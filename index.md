{% include section.html %}

Brains must adapt without losing reliable function.
We study the circuit mechanisms that keep behavior and perception stable over time.

### Problem
How does reliable processing arise in dynamic neuronal circuits and changing sensory environments?
"
approach="
### Approach
Closed-loop behavior, longitudinal optophysiology, and computational modeling across synapses, cells, and circuits.
"
scope="
### Scope
Mouse visual system, dorsal cortex, thalamus, and hippocampal formation, from milliseconds to months.

## Current Work

- Stable and flexible coding across visual and thalamocortical circuits
- Spatial and contextual processing in retrosplenial cortex
- Natural vision during active orienting behavior
- Latent learning in cortical memory networks

We test how stable coding emerges in changing circuits.
The program combines longitudinal imaging, behavior, and computational analysis.

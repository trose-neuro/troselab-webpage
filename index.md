Stability is a central challenge for the brain.
The brain must adapt to a changing world while preserving reliable perception, memory, and action.
We study the circuit mechanisms that stabilize computation and memory during passive experience and active behavior.

Our work spans the mouse visual system, dorsal cortex, thalamus, and hippocampal formation, from synapses to circuits and from milliseconds to months.
We combine closed-loop behavior, longitudinal optophysiology, and computational modeling.

## Current Program

- Long-term representational stability in visual thalamocortical circuits
- Stabilization of spatial and contextual representations in retrosplenial cortex during learning and memory
- Active visual orienting and peri-saccadic processing in natural vision

Seven current projects test how stable coding emerges in dynamic circuits.
The program combines longitudinal optophysiology, closed-loop behavior, deep modeling, and targeted perturbation.

All listed projects are current.
They cover representational drift, memory stabilization, active vision, uncertainty-dependent drift, affordance coding, and latent learning, with shared platform development.

# Rose Group

We study **circuit mechanisms of behavior** with a focus on visual perception, learning, and memory.
Our work addresses how neural representations remain stable enough for reliable behavior while circuits remain plastic.

## Research Focus

{% capture text %}

Our group investigates the stability-plasticity conundrum across the visual system, retrosplenial cortex, and hippocampal formation.
We combine longitudinal synapse- and circuit-level optophysiology with behavior in ecologically relevant settings.

# {% include icon.html icon="fa-solid fa-microscope" %}Research

We study how stable perception, memory, and action emerge in changing circuits in changing environments.

## Focus Areas

- Stability and drift across visual and thalamocortical pathways
- Spatial and contextual coding in retrosplenial circuits
- Natural vision and active orienting behavior
- State, neuromodulation, and uncertainty-dependent dynamics
- Latent learning and crossmodal integration in cortical circuits

{% include section.html %}

## Methods

- Longitudinal optophysiology at synapse, cell, and circuit scales
- Miniature and bench-top two-photon imaging
- Closed-loop behavioral paradigms with multimodal tracking
- Computational modeling and analysis across timescales

{% include section.html %}

## Direction

- Map structure-function rules of stable and flexible coding
- Build closed-loop perturbation and readout across hierarchies
- Link behavior and neural dynamics with predictive models

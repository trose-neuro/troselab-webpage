Our brain faces a fundamental challenge: on one hand, it needs to constantly rewire itself to learn from experience. On the other hand, it needs to consistently represent the external world to allow reliable action.

In the Rose Group at the IEECR, we study stability and stabilization of neural codes in visual perception, learning, and memory during passive experience and active behavior.

We address this stability-plasticity conundrum in the highly interconnected mouse visual system, retrosplenial cortex, and hippocampal formation across multiple scales, ranging from synapses to circuits.

## Ongoing research subjects

1. Cell-autonomous and circuit-dependent determinants of representational stability in the visual system, from retina to thalamus to visual cortex and back.
2. Transformation and consolidation of spatial and multimodal sensory representations in cortex, with focus on hippocampal and thalamic interactions with retrosplenial cortex during goal-directed behavior and contextual learning and memory.
3. Modulation of pathway-specific sensory processing in the early visual system by active behavioral context (active vision during goal-directed orienting behavior).

## Methods and approach

- Novel densely quantified behavioral paradigms with emphasis on ethologically relevant and unrestrained behavior
- Longitudinal synapse- and circuit-level optophysiology
- Miniaturized and bench-top two-photon microscopy

Ultimately, we aim to better understand circuit dynamics underlying adaptive but reliable visually guided behavior.

Our work examines circuit dynamics that support adaptive yet reliable visually guided behavior.

## Theme 1: Representational stability across visual pathways

We study cell-autonomous and circuit-dependent determinants of representational stability from retina to thalamus to visual cortex and feedback pathways.

## Theme 2: Transformation and consolidation of spatial and multimodal representations

We investigate hippocampal-thalamic interactions with retrosplenial cortex during goal-directed behavior and contextual learning.

## Theme 3: Behavioral-context modulation of early sensory processing

We examine pathway-specific modulation of early visual processing during active orienting and task engagement.

## Methods and approach

- Longitudinal two-photon imaging (miniaturized and bench-top)
- Dense behavioral quantification in ethologically relevant settings
- Cross-scale analysis from synapses to population dynamics

We study how stable perception, memory, and action arise from dynamic neural circuits in changing environments.

## Current Projects

{% include section.html %}

## Focus Areas

- Stability and drift across visual pathways
- Spatial and contextual coding in retrosplenial circuits
- Natural vision and active orienting behavior in freely moving mice
- State, neuromodulation, and uncertainty-dependent dynamics in cortical circuits
- Latent learning and crossmodal integration in cortical circuits

{% include section.html %}

## Methods

- Longitudinal optophysiology at synapse, cell, and circuit scales
- Miniature and bench-top two-photon imaging
- Closed-loop behavioral paradigms with multimodal tracking
- Computational modeling and analysis across spatial and temporal scales

## Directions

- Map structure-function rules of stable and flexible coding
- Build closed-loop perturbation and readout across hierarchies
- Link behavior and neural dynamics with predictive models in freely moving mice

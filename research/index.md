Stability is a central challenge for the brain.
Our central question is how reliable processing arises in dynamic circuits and changing sensory environments.
We study this stability-plasticity problem in the mouse visual system, dorsal cortex, thalamus, and hippocampal formation, from synapses to circuits and from milliseconds to months.

## Current Projects

- What are the cell-autonomous, circuit-specific, and behavioral state-dependent determinants of long-term representational stability? (Projects 1-2)
- How are spatial and contextual representations stabilized in retrosplenial cortex (RSC) during learning and memory? (Project 3)
- How is sensory processing stabilized and prioritized in natural vision during visual orienting behavior? (Project 4)

### Representational Drift and Stabilization

**Project 1.1**
We test whether higher-order cortical feedback stabilizes visual representations across dLGN, V1, and LM.
Using chronic two-photon imaging and deep receptive-field models, we quantify drift after LM->V1 feedback perturbation.

**Project 1.2**
We test whether cortical feedback stabilizes dLGN responses over time despite structural retinothalamic convergence.
This project is supported through DFG SPP 2411.

**Project 2**
We compare experience-dependent stabilization in V1 and hippocampal CA1 with sparse plasticity-gene manipulation and chronic two-photon imaging.
We contrast active navigation with passive replay to isolate task-engagement effects.

### Learning and Memory Stabilization

**Project 3**
We study how spatial and sensory representations in RSC stabilize during memory formation, consolidation, and updating.
Automated closed-loop tasks and miniature two-photon imaging test interactions among hippocampal inhibition, thalamic input, and subicular input to granular RSC.

### Natural Vision and Active Behavior

**Project 4**
We develop closed-loop visual orienting paradigms in freely moving mice.
Miniature two-photon imaging with gaze, pose, and egocentric scene tracking tests peri-saccadic modulation and remapping-like computations.

**Project 6**
We quantify how RSC and V1 encode landmark utility (stability, value, and salience) in gaze-contingent closed-loop navigation.
This work defines how affordance statistics shape stable versus flexible coding.

### Circuit Dynamics and State Modulation

**Project 5**
We test whether uncertainty-dependent states and cholinergic neuromodulation regulate representational drift during learning.
The project combines mesoscale and single-cell activity measurements with spatial transcriptomics in collaboration with SFB 1771 "Brain States".

**Project 7**
We are establishing a multisensory preconditioning paradigm in virtual reality to dissect unsupervised cue-association mechanisms in RSC and related circuits.
This links latent-learning behavior to cell-type-resolved circuit dynamics.

## Current Development Directions

- Structural rules of stability: longitudinal mapping of synaptic structure-function relationships in stable and drifting populations
- Closed-loop circuit mapping: patterned perturbation and readout across cortical hierarchies
- Digital twins for natural vision: deep models linking behavior, sensory history, and large-scale neural dynamics in freely moving animals

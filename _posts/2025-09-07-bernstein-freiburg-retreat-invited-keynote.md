<!-- excerpt start -->
I am looking forward to an invited keynote at the Bernstein Center Freiburg retreat on **October 8-10**, focused on **High-dimensional population activity: data acquisition and analysis**, at **Kloster Lichtenthal (Baden-Baden)**.

Many thanks to Christian and colleagues for the invitation. The retreat format will provide an excellent setting for focused discussion across data acquisition and analysis approaches in systems neuroscience.

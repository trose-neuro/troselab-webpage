<!-- excerpt start -->
I participated in the [**CAJAL Course on Interacting with Neural Circuits**](https://cajal-training.org/on-site/interacting-neural-circuits-2025/), held **June 8-27, 2025** at the **Champalimaud Centre for the Unknown, Lisbon, Portugal**.

The course provided a strong framework for discussing modern approaches to circuit architecture, activity dynamics, and causal perturbation across model systems.

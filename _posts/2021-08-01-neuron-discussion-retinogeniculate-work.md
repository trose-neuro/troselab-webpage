<!-- excerpt start -->
Our work was discussed in [**Neuron**](https://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(21)00499-2?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS0896627321004992%3Fshowall%3Dtrue), highlighting findings on eye-specific input convergence in the retinogeniculate pathway.

We are glad to see this discussion in Neuron and the broader interest in how visual inputs are integrated in thalamocortical circuits.

## Scientific Data and Code Handling

We use structured, reproducible workflows for acquisition, curation, analysis, and long-term reuse.  

ADAMACS (Architectures for Data Management and Computational Support) is our framework for managing and analyzing complex multimodal datasets. Built around DataJoint-based pipeline management, it supports structured data storage, metadata integration, computational workflows, and reproducible processing across experiments.
